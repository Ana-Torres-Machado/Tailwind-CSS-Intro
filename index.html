<!--According to the official Tailwind site, Tailwind is modernized tool that uses the latest CSS to make the experience more enjoyable for 
developers. However, it still has quite a few differences from another tool called Bootstrap. Both can modify the CSS of a site, but
Boostrap utilizes SASS, has JS components, has A LOT of mandatory imports if you plan to use it and it looks too advanced for those who are
just starting their coding and website development journey. Tailwind, on the other hand, is easier to comprehend, doesn't need too many
additional imports, and is a shortcutted version of CSS, and while I don't believe it uses SASS, it still has a lot of properties for us
to use with the concept of utility classes. Utility classes are the CSS properties that we can write inside the class property of a tag or
element, and unlike traditional CSS, it uses a shorter abbreviattion of these different styles which makes it less time consuming and more
convenient for developers to use.-->
